# gVisor HTTP Server Benchmark

The purpose of this benchmark is to measure the performance of gVisor's
networking stack and VFS layer. It is loosely based on the HTTP
benchmark found in the [gVisor
repository](https://github.com/google/gvisor/blob/3ad6d3056371b031fb0c16c4e365d5c7e60bdaf0/benchmarks/suites/http.py#L115).
