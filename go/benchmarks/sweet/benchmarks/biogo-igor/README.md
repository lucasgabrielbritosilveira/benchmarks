# biogo-igor Benchmark

This directory contains a benchmark that takes pairwise alignment data as
produced by PALS or krishna, and reports repeat feature family groupings in
JSON format. Powered by the biogo bioinformatics library.

The benchmark is a modified form of the Igor example which may be found in
the [biogo examples repository](https://github.com/biogo/examples) and thus
retains the [BSD-3-clause license](../../third_party/biogo-examples/LICENSE)
associated.
